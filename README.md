1. API Integration and Networking
Integrated the WeatherAPI using Retrofit for seamless HTTP requests.
Learned how to handle API keys securely and manage query parameters for real-time weather data.
2. Jetpack Compose UI Development
Built a responsive UI using Jetpack Compose, including dynamic layouts for user input and weather data display.
Implemented modern UI components like TextField, Button, and handled UI state management effectively.
3. State Management and LiveData
Managed UI states using LiveData and observed state changes with observeAsState() in Jetpack Compose.
4. Asynchronous Data Handling with Coroutines
Utilized Kotlin Coroutines to fetch data asynchronously without blocking the main thread.
Ensured safe exception handling for network requests.
5. Image Loading Using Coil
Dynamically fetched and displayed weather condition icons using Coil, optimizing image handling in the app.
6. Error Handling and UX Improvements
Designed user-friendly error messages for network failures and incorrect search queries.
Added loading effects (shimmer) during network calls to improve user experience.
7. Clean Architecture
Followed a clean and modular architecture by separating the data layer (Retrofit), UI layer (Compose), and logic (ViewModel).
